 	- Fixed Touch force choice to allow specific cues to be selected
	

* Revision 133 (24 Sep 2013)
- Fixed a critical bug in spike sorter. When the active units file is saved by stat server, saved channels are indexed
  i.e., if only channel 1 and 17 were recorded, it will be saved as "[1,2]". Spike sorted ignored that and literaly tried to 
  load channels [1,2], instead of [1,17]. This is now fixed.

* Revision 132 (30 August 2013)
- Modified spike sorter (visualization when zooming wasn't consistent)
  Modified the PCA projection, by taking into account the loads.
  
* Revision 131 (8 August 2013)
- Modified analysis scripts (new antidromic analysis script, etc)
- Added a time stamped variable for microstim source and amplitude to be able to infer which channel source was used to send antidromic pulses
- Major change in spikes RAW format (values are now in uV instead of AU).
- Databrwoser allows Auto Spike sorting on all channeels (useful for the axial array)
- Cleanup in the nano stimulation sketch 
- Revision in Statistical server (must load grids exported from new planner version)

* Revision 129 (11 July 2013)

- Fixed crash in passive fixation analysis script (SNR when no spikes)

* Revision 127 (9 July 2013)
- Fixed the time zone conversion bug (incorrect transformation).

* Revision 126 (8 July 2013)
- Fixed a bug in passive fixation analysis script (incorrect valid trial estimation due to problem in timestamp conversion)

- Added support for 64 bit MCC card
- Added fixation spot color change for fMRI block design paradigm


* Build 1022 14 Sep 2012 [version 3.0 beta]

- Added support for reading eye position using serial port
- Modified communication with Nano stimulator to serial port (fastest)
- Support for Arduino DAQ instead of MCC (future support for Intan boards. This will not work with plexon since Strobe word is not sent).
- Added support in Touch Force Choice to stimulate once saccade is initiated.
- Added support in Touch Force Choice to constrain the next possible trial types (i.e., have a "trial graph" like structure)
 

* Build 1021 26 May 2012 [version 2.0 beta]

	- Changes to Stimulus Server
	    * Added support for low-latency audio
		
	- Changes to Kofiko core
		* Added a time stamped variable to g_strctDAQParams which keeps track of microstim events.
		   Before, the only available information was a strobe word, lacking additional information, such as which channel was triggered
		   and which amplitude, etc.
		* Fixed the bug that prevented strobe words to be sent during mouse gaze emulator.
		* Fixed small bug in Kofiko (proper error message when stimulus server is not available, instead of a crash)
		* Added eye trace to better see saccades during force choice task
		* Added information in saved log files to find out whether a juice pulse was given manually or not.
		* Added Support for high definition audio on the kofiko machine. Please install ASIO drivers (see svn repository under /ThirdParty)
		
	- Changes to fMRI Block design paradigm (renamed, now called "BlockDesignNew")
	   * Designs are specified in XML. Three text file lists are not supported anymore. A conversion utility is available (fnConvertOldStyleBlockDesignToXML.m) under Utilities
	   * Support for displaying images at different presentation times (per image)
	   * Support for blocks with different number of TRs
	   * Support for multiple block orders
	   * Built in support for micro stim with different presets for different blocks
	   * See example file under \Documents\Examples for Block Design\
	   * New Rig file (MRI-Rig.xml)
	   * Analysis scripts updated. Support for different orders is still missing.
	   * Fixed the small bug in triggering
	   * Support for stimulation in multiple channels. Notice, there isa ~250usec delay in "simultaneous" triggering of channels due to two calls to fnDAQ
	     At the moment, the two channels are triggered at the same rate. 
		 
		 
	 - Changes to Touch Force choice:
		* Fixed the small bug that caused an extra flip in cue presentation
		* Global variables are not reset when reloading a design (unless specified)
		* Fixed small bug that caused choices to appear off center.
		* Added another flag "CueValidAttributesOR" to assist in selecting media files in a rule-based manner. The rule is now:
          (ALL(A \ E) & OR(D)) AND  NOT [ (B) \ (C) ], where
		  A is "CueValidAttributes", D is "CueValidAttributesOR", B is "CueInvalidAttributes" and C is "CueIgnoreAttributes"
		  and E is "CueValidIgnoreAttributes"
		  Logic should be backward compatible since when D or E are empty, it defaults to all available attributes.
		* Fixed a bug in the statistics (crash after load new design with more trial types)  
		* Added a feature to now show choices on the screen (used in saccade memory task). It is under block "ChoicesParam" and called "ShowChoicesOnScreen"
		  See example file "SaccadeMemoryTask.xml" under documents folder.
		* Added support for micro stimulation presets  
		* Added missing information in log file (Cues onset on screen)
		* Added more accurate timing information in log file for aborted trials
		* Added an option to run the paradigm in the scanner (Instead of specifying NumTrials per block, you specify NumberTR)
		  There is an additional check box to switch running in "fMRI mode", which will show a black screen until the first TR arrives,
		  and then will start running trials, automatically switching to the next block after the desired number of TRs has elapsed.
		* Added an option to microstimulate in "block mode" during fMRI mode  
		* Trial is aborted when user click on load new design
		* Added real time trial statistics table
		* Added "AbortedTrialPunishmentDelayMS" to PostChoice block to select a delay for aborted trials
		* Added "DelayPostTouchMS" to allow some delay between touching and first cue appearing.
		* Modified things such that the touch version of the force choice runs smoothly and also allows to play high definition sounds using ASIO

	 - Changes to Stat Server
		* Fixed the bug in selection of an exit script
		* Fixed a bug in Stat server (trial condition outcome filtering didn't work properly)
		* Fixed the bug for analog channel selection
		* Added the missing plexclient.dll to MEX32 folder
		
	- Changes to passive fixation
		* Support for micro stim repeat trains (Fixed rate / poisson)
		* Support for micro stim (only in certain blocks, and only for subsets of images). See Fixate_Microstim.xml
		* Fixed a recentering bug (did not do it correctly when screen was stretched)
		* The entire design is now saved as a timestamped variable.
	
	- Changes to Data Browser
		* Now supports fixing missing/extra strobe recorded in plexon with multiple frame files.
		* Allows to read multiple sessions within the same day
		* Data browser now supports sessions that were recorded without the Statistics server.
		* Population analysis GUI added.
		
	- Changes to Spike Sorter	
		* Spike sorter now supports KlustaKwik & inter-spike histogram
		* Fixed the bug with no annotation available
		* Fixed the bug with "zero" reference
		* Fixed the bug with multiple sessions in the same day leading to incorrect anotations
		
	- Changes to Analysis Pipelines
		* Fixed critical error in reading analog intervals using fnReadDumpAnalog with Resampling option when spanning multiple plexon frames.
		* Replaced the old force choice neural analysis pipeline with a new one that is compatible with Touch Force Choice
	
	* Other general changes:
	
	- Fixed a small bug in five dot (draw attention blacked out the screen).
	- Fixed the bug in Stat server (auto zoom)
	- Added a bunch of 3rd party libraries (circular statistics package, psychometric fitting function,...)
	
* Build 1020 (1 Nov 2011) [version 2.0 beta]

- Major revision in new force choice task (Note, old paradigms XML files may not be fully compatible!!!!)
    - Fixed many small bugs in cycle and callback functions
	- Juice time moved from TrialParams block to PostChoice ("DefaultJuiceRewardMS"), "JuiceTimeMS" removed from TrialParams block
	- New block in xml file (Global variables, see example file \Documents\Examples For Force Choice Designs\SaccadeTask.xml)
		* Global variables only support single dimension numeric values at the moment. Future versions may support strings/2D vales
		* Global variables can be automatically linked to GUI controllers
		* Global variables can be plugged in for any 1D numerical value in trial definition.
	- Two different fixation creterion are now available 
		* AbortTrialIfBreakFixationDuringCue : Keep monkey looking at cue
		* AbortTrialIfBreakFixationOnCue     : Keep monkey looking at fixation spot
	- New block in xml file (RealTimeStatistics, see example file \Documents\Examples For Force Choice Designs\SaccadeTask.xml)
		* Spike/LFP averaging is determined by a trial type to condition matrix. 
		* Conditions can include "Trial Outcome", which can either be "Correct", "Incorrect", or "Aborted". 
		* By default, statistics server discards all "aborted" trials
		* Future versions may include an option to define a condition by trial type, outcome and cue selected at run time.
		* Keep in mind that statistics server allocates a large chuck of memory
		  (#Channels x #Units per channel x #conditions x max trial length x ....)
		  So keep trials short as possible (time wise)....
		* Changing trial length at run time using some global variable is not advised and will lead to crashes on statistics server side....(buffers are only allocated once)
	- Strobe words are properly sent to plexon to be used with real time statistics server
	- Stimulation support
		* Micro stim can be applied at the onset of cues (+ POSITIVE delay)
		* Micro stim can be appplied at onset of chocies 
		* Micro stim parameters can be hooked up to global variables
		* Multi channel stimulation is now supported
	- Draw attention (disco button) now sends a signal back to the paradigm which is used to reset the current trial.
	- Draw on kofiko now shows choices response regions and fixation region as white circles.
	- Real time performance measures.  New panel in kofiko! instead of drawing things in PTB.
	   * Currently shows statistics for all designs. Future versions will show statistics per design as well (i.e., performance as a function of trial type or condition...).
	- SVN included in package. Used to infer the revision number (?) Still being tested.

- Modifications in passive fixation paradigm
	- Removed dual trigger/gate mechanism from micro stim
	- Images can now be linked to microstim event (see \Documents\Examples for Passive Fixation\FOB_Microstim.xml)

- Paradigms can inform Kofiko about their current state ("fnParadigmToKofikoComm('SetParadigmState'...)
- Major Revision in Analysis scripts: support for multiple plexon files for a single session (i.e.,
  split plexon files that are generated using PlexUtil)


Bug fixed:
- Fixed a mionr bug in the juice delivery in Passive Fixation



Changes to config files:
- Added a new "SessionBrowser.xml" config file that holds information about how to analyze units 



* Build 1003, [7 Jan 2010]

Major Changes
- Both stimulus server AND kofiko are running in non-blocking mode (with respect to network traffic).
  All paradigms have been completely rewritten to allow support for this type of cycle
- Stimulus server can recv commands (like "Clear screen", "Pause", "Resume", etc). Other commands are being dispatched
  to the corresponding draw function on the stimulus server
- Stimulus drawing function on Kofiko and on the stimulus server are now implemented as two separate functions
  (it is a bit of a code duplication, but allows better generalization for future paradigms).
   The draw on the stimulus server is now called "DrawCycle". It is a non blocking drawing function that handles timing issues
   accurately. It can also report events back to Kofiko by sending information such as "Flipped", or "Displayed finished"

- Additional revisions in the analysis scripts.
- Added support for a "plexon server" that does analysis after experiment is over. 
  User can send all available data from the Kofiko Machine to the "Season Browser" that is running on Plexon
  by clicking "Send Stats". If Season browser is listening, it will recv the information and analyze both kofiko and 
  plexon file that is currently being recorded.
 
- On the fly analysis for multiple channels is now working.


Changes to config file:
- Plexon server information
- Support for LFP ports
- Added Query and InitStimulusServer functions. Query is used when Kofiko wants to query a paradigm for specific information, such
 as the number of stimuli, etc. InitStimulusServer is called every time we switch back to a paradigm. So, for example, 
 in passive fixation, we want to restore the image list back to VRAM. This will take care of that.
- Added hot key for drawing attention 

Bug fix:
- Fixed the bug in IncreaseBufferSize. It will not crash when extending cell arrays
- Fixed the bug of loading a smaller image list after a long image list.

Other stuff:
- Added missing x64 bit version of fnMyInterp1 mex file
- Added hot keys (ALT-1, ALT-2,...) to switch between recorded channels. 
- Added Ping-pong process that tests that stimulus server is still alive and what is the latency for packets to travel around
- Session browser can handle any analog names as defined in Plexon Server

Known bugs:
- nojvm is not functional when using RegisterGUI

* Build 1002, [date unknown]

Major Changes
- Added the Register GUI
- Major revision in the analysis scripts, support for sessions and units 
- Session browser is now functional
- Added support for categories in Passive fixation paradigm
- Added online PSTH display
- In passive fixation paradigm, random images are displayed equally (preallocation of random indices)
- Major speed up. Cycle time is now 0.45 - 2/3 ms (1.8kHz)
  - Added the "Strip Buffer" function for each paradigm to speed things up
  - Removed many GetSecs from the cycle
  - Mouse & Keyboard are sampled every 60 ms and not in every cycle
  - Statistics are drawn using PTB


Bug fix:
- Fixed a major bug in valid trial analysis in Session Browser
